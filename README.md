===

> This project is not finished yet and therefore not documented yet. This tool will rename classes (currently set in the cli.ts around r89) and commit the project. Obviously this needs to be finished


## Development

This is developed using the Mendix Model SDK and Typescript. To do development, check out the repository and make sure you have the typescript compiler installed (``npm install tsc -g``). After you have installed the dependencies (``npm install``) you can run the compiler by running ``npm run build`` or ``npm run execute`` (this will do a build and execute the client)
